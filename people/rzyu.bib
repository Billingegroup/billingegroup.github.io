 ackno = {Work at Brookhaven National Laboratory was supported by U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (DOE-BES) under Contract DESC0012704. Work at Argonne National Laboratory was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Materials Sciences and Engineering. The neutron diffraction measurements were carried out at NPDF instrument of the Lujan Neutron Scattering Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the x-ray experiments were carried out at beamline 28-ID-2 (XPD) of the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Use of the National Synchrotron Light Source II, Brookhaven National Laboratory, was supported by DOE-BES under Contract No. DESC0012704.
