 synopsis = {Non negative matrix factorization was tested against simulated and real PDF data from the discharge of a battery electrode.  It was shown that, although this is a purely mathematical data reduction process, it resulted in mathematical components that strongly resembled real physical components in the system, and weights that closely followed the time evolution of the real physical components.  Software was also presented that allowed nmf to take place even when data were streaming from an experiment as well as in batch mode from a finished experiment.},

 summary_professional = {The optical float-zone furnace approach for growing large single crystals is a foundational practice in science as it is the best and sometimes only way to grow such crystals from complex materials. However, the practice is considered as something of a ``black art" where the outcomes are sensitively dependent on parameters used in the growth.  There is little fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry of the nucleation and growth processes.  Progress will be made if the positions, shapes and qualities of crystallites that form during the growth process could be tracked in a non-destructive way, such as in an in situ growth at an x-ray synchrotron.  For this to succeed it is necessary to have data analysis protocols and analysis tools that can do this mapping in a rapid fashion. This work demonstrated a proof of principle of such grain mapping from previously grown TiO2 boules, making use of advanced image processing tools for tracking and mapping the grains.},
 synopsis = {Spatial mapping of diffraction patterns from a boule that was grown in an optical float zone furnace was carried out and automated tools for tracking the grains were developed.  The regions that were good powders were separated from those that had a few crystals of a single crystal.  In the latter regions, image processing methods such as blob tracking were used to map the positions and crystal quality of crystallites in the beam.  The ultimate goal will be to carry out these measurements in an in situ crystal growth context.},

 summary_professional = {A major challenge when doing experiments at modern high intensity x-ray synchrotron sources is the data velocity: the amount of data and the speed of the data.  For scientists to be able to make assessments of their experiment in real time it is important for them to be able to set up analysis protocols that can consume the data as it arrives and does preliminary analyses and plotting.  Here we developed a software infrastructure for doing this.  The SHED (Streaming Heterogeneous Event Data) software package is a software framework that can be used by researchers to pre-build data analysis pipelines that can be deployed at an instrument at NSLS-II (National Synchrotron Light Source II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory that will take data coming from the instrument, carry out the analysis and then create plots of the results even as the data are streaming off the instrument.  It is written in python and is available on Github at \url{https://github.com/xpdAcq/SHED.}},
