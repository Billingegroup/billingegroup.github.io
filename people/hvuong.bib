 ackno = {This research was partially supported by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation through a Beckman Young Investigator grant awarded to J.A.M. and Beckman Postdoctoral Fellowships to M.I.G. and A.H.S. Synthesis, crystallography, thermal characterization, and EXAFS experiments were supported by the Office of Naval Research under award N00014-19-1-2148. Studies of metal–bis(acetamide) glass formation were supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) under award DE-SC0021145. The PDF work was supported by the NSF MRSEC program through Columbia in the Center for Precision Assembly of Quantum Materials (PAQM) (DMR-2011738). We thank Dr. ShaoLiang Zheng for assistance with crystallography experiments and data analysis. We thank Dr. Sungsik Lee for assistance with EXAFS experiments and data analysis. EXAFS measurements were conducted on beamline 12-BM at the Advanced Photon Source, a DoE Office of Science User Facility operated for the DoE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. We thank Dr. Maxwell Terban for assistance with PDF data analysis. X-ray PDF measurements were conducted on beamline 28-ID-2 of the National Synchrotron Light Source II, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Brookhaven National Laboratory under Contract No. DESC0012704.},
