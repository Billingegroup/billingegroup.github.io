 summary_professional = {A major challenge when doing experiments at modern high intensity x-ray synchrotron sources is the data velocity: the amount of data and the speed of the data.  For scientists to be able to make assessments of their experiment in real time it is important for them to be able to set up analysis protocols that can consume the data as it arrives and does preliminary analyses and plotting.  Here we developed a software infrastructure for doing this.  The SHED (Streaming Heterogeneous Event Data) software package is a software framework that can be used by researchers to pre-build data analysis pipelines that can be deployed at an instrument at NSLS-II (National Synchrotron Light Source II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory that will take data coming from the instrument, carry out the analysis and then create plots of the results even as the data are streaming off the instrument.  It is written in python and is available on Github at \url{https://github.com/xpdAcq/SHED.}},
