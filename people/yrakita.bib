This research used beamline 9-BM of the Advanced Photon Source, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. Parts of the research were performed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), managed by UT Battelle, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725. We thank George Sterbinsky for support in using the 9-BM beamline.},

Starting at the top and moving anti-clockwise, the "knobs" on the apparatus that control gas flow and temperature are set by computer control. The subsequent reaction takes place in the apparatus (left) that is mounted in an x-ray beam resulting in an x-ray absorption spectrum (lower left) that is measured in real-time. Software computes whether the changes in the spectrum (bottom) are producing a trajectory taking us towards the target (lower right). The AI agent uses this information to decide on new settings for the knobs on the apparatus that it thinks will take us closer to the target (top right), and sets them (top) and the cycle repeats. There is no human in the loop.},
