 professional_summary = {In situ experiments taking place in the x-ray beam at modern synchrotrons, for example, in situ synthesis, produce data at very high velocities.  It becomes very difficult to assess the results of the experiment in real time, and the scientist is left with terabytes of data on return to their institution.  In situ powder diffraction and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) data has the structure that it is a time-series of spectra that evolve continuously in time which is well suited to principal component analysis (PCA) and non negative matrix factorization (NMF).  Here we showed that NMR can work in this context and furthermore, produces components that match signals from real materials, and weights that resemble the time evolution of those chemical constituents in the real system. This was validated against synthetic data where we knew the exact answer, and also against real measured data that are subject to experimental aberrations.  The NMF was shown to perform well and can rapidly give a clear picture of what is going on in the experiment in a completely model-free way.  We demonstrated it operating in a streaming context, allowing experiments to be followed in real time, and also in batch mode to help speed up post-experiment analysis.},
 synopsis = {Non negative matrix factorization was tested against simulated and real PDF data from the discharge of a battery electrode.  It was shown that, although this is a purely mathematical data reduction process, it resulted in mathematical components that strongly resembled real physical components in the system, and weights that closely followed the time evolution of the real physical components.  Software was also presented that allowed nmf to take place even when data were streaming from an experiment as well as in batch mode from a finished experiment.},
