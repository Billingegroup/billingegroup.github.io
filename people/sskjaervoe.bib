 ackno = {Experimental work was co-led by the groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Theoretical work was led by ETH. Work at BNL was supported by U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (DOE-BES) under Contract No. DE-SC0012704. The NTNU group acknowledges financial support from the Research Council of Norway (Project No. 231430) and NTNU. The ETH group was supported by ETH Zürich and Advanced Grant No. 291151 from the European Research Council. This research used resources at the Spallation Neutron Source, a DOE Office of Science User Facility operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Computational resources were provided by the Euler cluster at ETH, Zürich. Matt Tucker and Marshall McDonnell are acknowledged for assisting with the data collection for the neutron measurements. Matt Tucker is acknowledged for constructing TOPAS input files for reciprocal-space Rietveld refinements. Jörg Neuefeind and Pavol Juhas are acknowledged for assisting with manual data reduction and quality testing. Peter M. Derlet is acknowledged for constructive feedback on the manuscript.},
