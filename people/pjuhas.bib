variables, spatially based crossover operator, a small mutation,

based objective function to generate candidate molecule
conformations from atomic pair distance data. To better simulate
experimental data only information from the pair distance data is
used as constraints. Ideal Bucky ball with 60 atoms is used as the
test case with both perfect pair distance data and Gaussian noise
perturbed pair distance data. The GA generated result shows
molecules close to ideal Bucky balls but with some defects. A
description of the spatially based crossover operator is provided
along with a local search based on vector summed error for each

 abstract = {The methods currently used to calculate atomic pair distribution functions (PDFs) from organic structural models do not distinguish between the intramolecular and intermolecular distances. Owing to the stiff bonding between atoms within a molecule, the PDF peaks arising from intramolecular atom{--}atom distances are much sharper than those of the intermolecular atom{--}atom distances. This work introduces a simple approach to calculate PDFs of molecular systems without building a supercell model by using two different isotropic displacement parameters to describe atomic motion: one parameter is used for the intramolecular, the other one for intermolecular atom{--}atom distances. Naphthalene, quinacridone and paracetamol were used as examples. Calculations were done with the {\it DiffPy-CMI} complex modelling infrastructure. The new modelling approach produced remarkably better fits to the experimental PDFs, confirming the higher accuracy of this method for organic materials.},
