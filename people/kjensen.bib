Banerjee acknowledges support from the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (DOD-NDSEG) program. Juhás was supported by the New York State BNL Big Data Science Capital Project under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contract No. DE-SC-00112704. Jensen is grateful for funding from the Villum foundation through a Villum Young Investigator grant. Sample synthesis for the Pd nanoparticles discussed here was supported as part of the Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (DOE-BES) under award No. DE-SC0001004. Ackerson acknowledges support from NSF CAREER 1455099. Gold nanocluster data collection at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory was supported by the DOE-BES under contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357. Measurements of Pd nanoparticles were conducted on beamline 28-ID-2 (XPD) at the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a DOE-BES user facility under contract No. DE-SC0012704.},
